        <h3>Hi, do you know, there was a Christmas fun session today at our tution. Everytime when<br>
            the exam ends, we have a fun session at our tution. Recently, our PT2s(Periodic<br>
            Tests) ended. Our techer told that we would celebrate the CID (Children's<br>
            Independence Day(From exams)) fun session at Christmas so it would be fun.<br>
            Mam told that everyone can bring a board game, so I took Chess there.<br>
            But, when we started mam said that we're not playing<br>
            board games. We played another games e.g. one of them was Treasure<br>
            Hunt. There were taccos, salad, chips and some cookies in the snacks.<br>
            I enjoyed the games except one. We had to the opposite of what ma'am says. For<br>
            example, if mam says down, we have to keep our faces up. So, I was<br>
            out from the game in the 1st round. Mam also told that<br>
            in the Final(Annual) Exams, if everyone brings full marks<br>
            in Maths, English or Science, we'll have<br>
            a pizza party for it. In the PT2s also 3 students in our class brang full marks.
